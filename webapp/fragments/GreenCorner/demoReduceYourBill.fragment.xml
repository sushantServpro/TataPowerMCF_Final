							Energy conservation and reducing bills should become a mantra to be competitive for everyone. The way one would exercise every day, we
							recommend our customers to reflect on some simple solutions and options that can be implemented without any specialised support. It's proven
							that as high as 10 to 15% of savings can come through no-cost or low-cost options evolving from changing operational practices.

							If you are on a two-part tariff, one basic component of your bill is the demand charge. Options available for an industrial consumer is to
							identify processes that run simultaneously but are not essential for the main production. Such processes should be operated in series as
							against in parallel to save on the total demand. Example - if you are running baking ovens in a particular shift and are also running large
							dryers during the same shift, you can always, change the shift operations to run the two processes in series instead of parallel. Other
							example - if you pump water from municipal source to overhead tanks, try and run the pumps during the time when main process is not
							operational. This will save total demand.

							Watch your bills and study if you are paying power factor penalty. If you are, assess the benefit-cost of installing capacitor banks or
							Automatic Power Factor Correction panels and savings due to reduced power factor penalty.

								Demand Side Management (DSM) refers to cooperative activities between the utility and its customers (sometimes with the assistance of third
								parties such as energy services companies and various trade allies) to implement options for increasing the efficiency of energy
								utilisation, with resulting benefits to the customer, utility and society as a whole.

									Based on the results of the load research in the utility, DSM teams define the load shape objectives for the current situation. Various
									load-shape objectives - Peak Clipping (reduction in the peak demand), Valley Filling (increased demand at off-peak), Load Shifting (demand
									shifting to non-peak period), and Load Building (increased demand) are possible. These are represented in figure below.

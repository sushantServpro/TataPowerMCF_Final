						<html:h5>Power reaches to you from substation through line or cable. At your end power supply is fed through cut-outs / fuses installed in
							your house or in your building near your meter. Power failure occurs most commonly due to blown fuse or due to cable damage. The fuse may
							blow due to short-circuit or overloading of equipment. Further in spite of our best efforts to provide uninterrupted power, there could be
							problem in the line or in cable between substation and powerhouse due to storms or falling of trees.</html:h5>

							Although we make all possible efforts to get all customers back online as quickly as possible, the actual time required to restore power may
							vary depending upon nature of failure. You may ask Call Centre to provide estimated time of restoration. Call Centre will provide this
							information once the problem is identified. If power is not restored within few hours or your neighbor's power has come back but yours is
							still off, you may contact Call Centre again to get the latest status on power restoration.</html:h5>

						<html:h5>Residential customer can use Gen Set in their house during power outage or failure. However commercial and industrial customers
							require separate permission to do so. However generator should be connected after isolating main supply through a double throw switch to
							break main circuit before Gen Set circuit is made. It should never be plugged or connected to main supply inlet in the house. If it is
							connected in the same circuit, electricity will travel through power line or transformer, creating mortal danger to utility personnel
							working on the line. This switch is also required to protect Gen Set and appliances in your house when regular power supply is restored.</html:h5>

							Tata Power is a part of Western regional power grid along with other utilities such as MSEB, BSES, GSEB, MPEB etc. Any disturbance in this
							western grid results into voltage fluctuation for a very short duration and is beyond the control of Tata Power. We take every care to avoid
							such disturbances and also try to restrict their duration and effect.

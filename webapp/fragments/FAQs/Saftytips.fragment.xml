							Any leakage current above 30 mA, if it flows through the human body makes it a part of the circuit and can cause Cardio Pulmonary Failure
							(Stopping of breathing and heart function) even for a short while. Hence it is not advisable to install ELCB of settings higher than 30 mA.
							The cause of tripping such probable leakage in the circuit should be established and attended.

					<html:div class="textpara">
						<html:h5>It is recommended to have Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker in your house it acts as a safeguard from electrical shocks. Even if it trips frequently due to leakage in the circuit, it should not be bypassed. Instead electrical appliances and circuits should be checked by a qualified electrician.</html:h5>

					<html:div class="textpara">
						<html:h5>
						Any leakage current above 30 mA, if it flows through the human body makes it a part of the circuit and can cause Cardio Pulmonary Failure (Stopping of breathing and heart function) even for a short while. Hence it is not advisable to install ELCB of settings higher than 30 mA. The cause of tripping such probable leakage in the circuit should be established and attended.

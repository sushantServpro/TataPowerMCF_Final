										MF means Multiplying Factor which is used to calculate your bill.

									<html:h5>
										Energy meters are generally designed to withstand continuously 440 Volts and a maximum of 60 A current.
									</html:h5>
								</html:li>
								<html:li>
									<html:li>
										<html:h5>
											If customer's load is more than 60 A or supply voltage is higher than 440 Volts, Current and voltage transformers are used in metering
											circuit to restrict the current and voltage to the rated capacity of meter.
										</html:h5>
									</html:li>
									<html:h5>
										These transformers reduce the voltage &amp; current applied to meter in certain proportion which is called transformation ratio.
									</html:h5>
								</html:li>
								<html:li>
									<html:h5>
										The consumption recorded by the meter is therefore less than the actual consumption of the customer in the same proportion.
									</html:h5>
								</html:li>
								<html:li>
									<html:h5>
										To arrive at actual consumption of customer, consumption registered by meter is multiplied by proportionality factor which is called
										Multiplying factor or MF.
									</html:h5>
								</html:li>
								<html:li>
									<html:h5>
										Thus MF = CT ratio X VT ratio</html:h5>
								</html:li>
								<html:li>
									<html:h5>
										The ratio for CT &amp; VT for a particular customer is designed in accordance with customer's load requirement and load pattern.

								that are send to the customers are based on actual consumption of the customer in the particular month.

								Upon receiving the complaint through the "Call Centre", the meter reading will be checked and the meter tested. If meter tests healthy, it
								would mean that the meter had recorded correctly. The responsibility of the customer's main switch rests on the customer. If someone has
								used electricity supply tapping from this main switch, the company is not responsible and the owner has to pay for the units recorded. It
								is, therefore, in owner's interest to keep the meter under lock and key with access to the responsible authorised personnel only.

							<html:h5>The meter will be tested on a dispute raised by the customer on payment of testing fees. If it is found to be beyond the tolerance
								limits, the testing fees will be refunded. If the meter or metering installation develops a fault or ceases to register the actual
								consumption or maximum demand, the consumption during the defective period will be assessed based on the MERC guidelines and necessary
								correction will be given as applicable. If you apprehend that the meter is not functioning correctly, report immediately so that checking
								and rectification can be carried out. If the meter or metering installation is found tampered with, the Company would assess the consumption
								and bill for the same. Penalty will also be changed as per Electricity Act. If a person tampers with company's installation the person is
								liable for imprisonment and or fine as per the Electricity Act.

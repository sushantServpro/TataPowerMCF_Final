								Mumbai is the one Indian city that has always enjoyed uninterrupted, 24-hour power supply. Something that we in Mumbai are rightly proud of.
								However, following the severe power shortage faced by State of Maharashtra and the city's unprecedented lifestyle boom, this envied status
								of uninterrupted power is under threat. While efforts are on to plug the power deficit of 400-500 MW in Mumbai through alternate resources,
								with summer around the corner, we could be in for a power shortage crisis during the peak hours of 10 am - 8 pm.

								But it doesn't have to be that way, if we act now. A few simple steps and we can avoid power cuts. But before we list out those steps, just

							<html:h4>Shift consumption away from the 10 am - 8 pm peak times:</html:h4>
							<html:p>
								Let's avoid adding to the power demand during this peak time. By simply using some of our common electrical appliances before and after this
								time band. Washing machines, geysers, irons, water pumps in buildings - all can be shifted without much inconvenience.

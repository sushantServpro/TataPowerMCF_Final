								TATA POWER is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you, we
								receive from you, on the Internet. In general, you can visit TATA POWER on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing
								any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is
								aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. TATA POWER uses this information to measure
								the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. Your accessing our site signifies your unconditional consent to allow the
								collection of your domain names.

								There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will try (but
								are not obligated) to let you know at the time of collection, how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we
								collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. Occasionally,
								we may make the e-mail addresses, of those who provide information, available to other reputable organisations whose products or services we
								think you may find interesting. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access to your information. In case we do not
								receive any response from you to limit the access of your information, it shall be deemed that you consent to such distribution of your
								information as mentioned above. If you register with one of TATA POWER's website, they may use this information to provide you with customer
								information about TATA POWER's offering in support of your needs. A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored
								information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we
								can recognise you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Registering with any TATA POWER website
								online signifies your unconditional consent to receive such cookies.

								At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will try (but
								are not obligated) to let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet. You
								recognise and understand that there is no compulsion on you to provide us with your personal information and any and all personal
								information provided by you to us is with your full consent, own wish and desire to provide such personal information. You also understand
								that we are under no obligation to verify the source from which the personal information about you is provided to us, and they are deemed to
								be provided by you, unless you demonstrate to us within a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of providing of such information to us,
								to our satisfaction, that the information was provided to us without your free consent.
